Fuel Flow: Space Rescue Challenge Rules

Bonus Tagline:
"7 liters between life and doom... Tick tock, astronaut!"

Program Description
Target Audience: Puzzle lovers & aspiring astronauts (ages 12+)

In this high-stakes puzzle game, you start with a 9L Main Tank filled with fuel, while the 5L Backup Tank and 4L Emergency Tank are empty. A critical 3-minute oxygen countdown timer in the top right corner adds urgency—run out of time, and it’s game over. Transfer fuel between tanks. Each transfer takes 5 seconds off the countdown, so plan your moves carefully. Monitor the remaining capacity displayed beneath each tank, which updates in real-time (e.g., "Main Tank: 9L → 4L").
Your mission? Fill any tank with exactly 7L of fuel. Once achieved, a victory animation plays, followed by a step-by-step recap of your winning moves. Quick thinking and precise fuel management are key to escaping the void! 
Subsequent levels of the game will challenge other values and introduce oil spill emergencies.

Features include:
Real-time oxygen countdown
Step-by-step solution replay
Achievements for optimal play
Error-proof input system

Math teachers demonstrating measurement concepts
